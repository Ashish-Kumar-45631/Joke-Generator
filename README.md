# Joke Generator App

This is a simple Joke Generator application that fetches and displays jokes to brighten your day! The app uses a custom React hook for fetching jokes and manages the loading status, error handling, and refreshing jokes.

## Features

- **Fetch Jokes:** The custom hook fetches jokes from an API, returning the joke data, loading status, and error status.
- **Loading State:** Displays a "Loading..." message when the joke data is being fetched.
- **Error Handling:** Shows an error message ("Something went wrongâ€¦") if there's an issue during the API request.
- **New Joke Functionality:** Includes a "New Joke" button that fetches and displays a new joke when clicked.
